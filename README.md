## üìö Course Context
This course introduces:  
- The **MIPS Assembly Language** and low-level programming concepts
- Instruction sets, addressing modes, and control flow
- CISC Assembly: Intel and IBM

*Note: This repo is MIPS Assembly codes collection, Which is main purpose of course, especially in Assembly coding.*

  Each subfolder corresponds to one practical question in assignment and contains one `.asm` file and maybe multiple input and output examples. For example:  
  - computer-structure-course-mips/  
    - assignment_1/  
      - 1/
        - Q1.asm
        - input1.txt 
        - input2.txt 
        - input3.txt 
        - input4.txt  
        - output1.txt
        - output2.txt
        - output3.txt
        - output4.txt


## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements
To run the programs, you need the **MARS simulator** (MIPS Assembler and Runtime Simulator).  
MARS (MIPS Assembler and Runtime Simulator) is a lightweight IDE and simulator for MIPS Assembly programming. It's **Java-based**, so you just need Java installed to run it.:

#### Download
- Go to the MARS official site: https://dpetersanderson.github.io/download.html
- This is also project releases page on GitHub: https://github.com/dpetersanderson/MARS/releases
- You should download `.jar` file.

#### Installation
- MARS doesn't require installation like normal software; you just run the `.jar` file directly.
- Make sure Java JDK (or at least JRE) is installed on your system (since MARS is a Java application).
- Place the Mars4_5.jar file anywhere on your computer.
- Run it by double-clicking the file, or via command line (At first you should go to specified directory):
```bash
java -jar Mars4_5.jar
```


## üöÄ How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AmirMohammad-Sharbati/computer-structure-course-mips.git
cd computer-structure-course-mips
```
1. Open MARS (`Mars4_5.jar`).  
1. Load a program:
    Go to `File > Open`, then select the `.asm` file you want (e.g., assignment1/1/Q1.asm). 
1. Assemble and run: 
    Click Assemble to compile. 
    Use Run to execute the program.

## üìù Notes
- These codes are my course exercises and may not cover every topic in the course.  
- The main goal is practice and learning, not providing ready-made solutions. If you are taking this course, use these codes for inspiration and learning, not direct copying.  
- In implementation of these codes, [Arya Kohbanany](https://github.com/aryakohbanany) was my teammate.  
- Another repository related to this course is our final project. You can see it and give us star :) The link is this: ...
