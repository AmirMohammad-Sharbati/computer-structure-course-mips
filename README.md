# 🖥️ Computer Structure and Machine Language - MIPS Exercises (SUT, Fall 2024)
This repository contains my MIPS Assembly implementations for the **Computer Structure and Machine Language (CSML)** course at **Sharif University of Technology (SUT)** — Semester 3 (Fall 2024).

## 📚 Course Context
This course introduces:  
- The **MIPS Assembly Language** and low-level programming concepts
- Instruction sets, addressing modes, and control flow
- An introduction to **CISC Assembly** (Intel x86 and IBM), with limited programming practice in these ISAs  

*Note: This repository is a collection of MIPS Assembly programs from course assignments, which are the main focus of the course, especially in Assembly coding.*


## 📂 Repository Structure
- assignment_1/  
    - `1/` ... `4/`  
    - `assignment.pdf`  
    - `explanation_Q1.jpg`  
- assignment_2/  
    - `1/` ... `5/`  
    - `assignment.pdf`
- assignment_3/ 
    - `1/` ... `7/`  
    - `assignment.pdf`
- assignment_4/  
    - `1/` ... `5/`
    - `assignment.pdf`
- LICENSE  
- README.md

- Each `assignment_X` folder contains subfolders for each question (`1/`, `2/`, ...) and the assignment statement (`assignment.pdf`).  
- Each question folder contains the `.asm` source file and optional input/output examples. 


## ⚙️ Requirements
To run the programs, you need the **MARS simulator** (MIPS Assembler and Runtime Simulator).  
MARS is a lightweight IDE and simulator for MIPS Assembly programming. Since it is **Java-based**, you just need Java installed to run it.

#### Download
- Go to the MARS official site: https://dpetersanderson.github.io/download.html
- This is also project releases page on GitHub: [MARS Releases](https://github.com/dpetersanderson/MARS/releases)
- Download the latest `.jar` file (e.g., `Mars4_5.jar`).

#### Installation
- MARS doesn't require installation like normal software; you just run the `.jar` file directly.
- Make sure Java JDK (or at least JRE) is installed on your system (since MARS is a Java application).

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AmirMohammad-Sharbati/computer-structure-course-mips.git
cd computer-structure-course-mips
```
1. Start MARS:
    Run it by double-clicking the downloaded `Mars*.jar`, or run:
```bash
java -jar /path/to/Mars4_5.jar
```
1. Load a program:
    Go to `File > Open`, then select the `.asm` file you want (e.g., assignment1/1/Q1.asm). 
1. Assemble and run: 
    Click Assemble (F3) to assemble the program. 
    Click Run (F5) to execute it.

## 📝 Notes
- These programs are course exercises and may not cover every topic in the course.  
- The main goal is practice and learning. If you are taking this course, use these codes for inspiration and learning, not direct copying. 
- Example input/output files are included where relevant.
- The implementations were developed in collaboration with my teammate, [Arya Kohbanany](https://github.com/aryakohbanany).
