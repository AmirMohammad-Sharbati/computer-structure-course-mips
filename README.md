## üìö Course Context
This course introduces:  
- The **MIPS Assembly Language** and low-level programming concepts
- Instruction sets, addressing modes, and control flow
- CISC Assembly: Intel and IBM

*Note: This repo is MIPS Assembly codes collection, Which is main purpose of course, especially in Assembly coding.*

Each folder corresponds to one assignment and contains multiple .asm files implementing different problems. Each question has one .asm file and maybe multiple input and output examples.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements
To run the programs, you need the **MARS simulator** (MIPS Assembler and Runtime Simulator):

- üì• Download: MARS official site
- Requirements:  
    - Java Runtime Environment (JRE) (since MARS is a Java application)

## üöÄ How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AmirMohammad-Sharbati/computer-structure-course-mips.git
cd computer-structure-course-mips
```
1. Open MARS (`MARS.jar`).  
1. Load a program:
    Go to `File > Open`, then select the `.asm` file you want (e.g., Assignment1/prog1.asm). 
1. Assemble and run: 
    Click Assemble (F3) to compile. 
    Use Run (F5) to execute the program.

## üìù Notes
- These codes are my course exercises and may not cover every topic in the course.  
- The main goal is practice and learning, not providing ready-made solutions. If you are taking this course, use these codes for inspiration and learning, not direct copying.  
- In implementation of these codes, [Arya Kohbanany](https://github.com/aryakohbanany) was my teammate.  
- Another repository related to this course is our final project. You can see it and give us star :) The link is this: ...
